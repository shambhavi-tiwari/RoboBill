## Reporting a Vulnerability

This is just a trial app made using Streamlit, and doesn't ensure the corectness of the output given by Gemini Pro Vision.

## Safety Settings
I haven't updated the safety settings, and thus the project is vulnerable to images subject to self-harm, violence, sexually-explicit content, etc.
